.emacs.d
========

My emacs configuration

I use a personally modified version of [better-defaults] (https://github.com/dacamo76/better-defaults) by [@technomancy] (https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults) as a submodule. (I like the menu bar so that is the only modification for now)

If cloning the repository, run

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dacamo76/.emacs.d.git
```

to install the submodules.

If the repository is already cloned, update the submodule by moving into the .emacs.d directory and running

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
